# Experiment5

AIM: To study and implement C++ decision making statements. <br>

THEORY: <br>
Based on certain conditions decision making statments in C++ allow you ti control the flow of execution. Some decision making statements in C++ are: <br>
1) if statement : It evaluates a condition. If the condition is true, the block inside the 'if' statement is executed. <br>
2) if-else statement : It provides alternative path of execution if the condition under 'if' statement is false. <br>
3) if-else-if ladder : It helps in checking multiple consitions. The control will go down until a condition which is true is found. <br>
4) nested if : It is an 'if' statement which consists of one or more 'if' statement inside it. Used for creating complex decision making structures. <br>
5) switch statement : The 'switch' statement is the control statement which changes the control of execution based on option or cases provided.
